# Build

Compile and test
```
./gradlew build
```

Compile only
```
./gradlew assemble
```

Test
```
./gradlew test
```

For those who use Windows, you should run `gradlew.bat` with the same parameters.

Both IDEA and Eclipse have plugins for Gradle.

Some existing tests need Java 8.


# Code location

`src/main/java` is for word count code.

`src/test/java` is for tests. And `src/test/resources` is for test data.
